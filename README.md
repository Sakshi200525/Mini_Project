# Mini_Project
This is a **Student Result Analysis System**, a C++ mini-project that reads student data from a `Data.txt` file to provide various analysis features. The program includes a simple login, a loading screen, and a menu to **search for student details**, display **overall and subject-wise toppers**, and **generate detailed report cards** by PRN, including total marks and percentage.
